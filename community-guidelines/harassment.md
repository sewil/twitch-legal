Hateful Conduct and Harassment [CURRENT]
NOTE: THIS POLICY WILL NO LONGER BE IN EFFECT AS OF JANUARY 22, 2021 AT 9:59AM PST, AT WHICH POINT WE WILL BEGIN ENFORCING THE NEW POLICY.

Twitch is a space for people to create, join, and participate in communities that share their interests. We want everyone to be able to express themselves on Twitch, but it’s important that we do so in ways that allow everyone to flourish. This means preventing, protecting users from, and moderating hateful behavior and harassment.

We support Twitch users who express diverse or unpopular points of view, or do so in humorous or controversial ways, but make your intent clear. We don’t tolerate conduct that encourages or condones hate or harassment in any way. Ignorance is not an acceptable excuse for conduct that results in hate or harassment.

We understand that there are many ways in which behavior might be interpreted as hateful or harassing. When reviewing reported content or activity, we will consider its intent and context. To provide more clarity around the these policies and how we handle such conduct, we’ve provided additional details to complement our Community Guidelines in the sections below.

Communities Responsible for Hateful Conduct and Harassment
Creators are role models and leaders of the communities they create or foster around them. Creators should consider the consequences of their statements and actions of their audiences; we ask that you make a good faith effort to quell any efforts from those in your community to harass others.

Twitch should not be used to incite, encourage, promote, facilitate, or organize hateful conduct or harassment, whether on or off Twitch. We will suspend communities, organizations, and individuals that do so.

Hateful Conduct and Harassment In-Person or Off-Twitch
The Twitch community is also at conventions, TwitchCon, Twitch Community Meetups, and even social media. Our community encompasses all of these spaces and we take them into consideration when it comes to our role in keeping the community safe. We may take action against persons for hateful conduct or harassment that occurs off Twitch services that is directed at Twitch users.

Additional Restrictions
If examples of hateful conduct or harassment are shared in an educational context, such as news reporting or a documentary, or raising awareness about the ways in which such conduct is bad, we ask that you express your intent clearly and mark such content as mature.

How to Report and Manage Hate and Harassment on Twitch
We want everyone on Twitch to feel safe and to speak up against hate and harassment. If a comment, gesture, or behavior is unwelcome, please consider the following options:

Clearly communicate that sort of attention is unwanted.
Manage their ability to interact with you with functionality like blocks, bans, and timeouts.
Moderate their chat by tuning AutoMod, adding keywords to your Blocked words list, recruiting trusted Moderators, and using other recommendations from our guide on How to Manage Harassment in Chat.

Always report a violation of Twitch’s Terms of Service (ToS) or Community Guidelines (CG) when you see it occur. Learn How to File a User Report
Escalating Serious Misconduct
If you feel that hateful conduct or harassment rises to a legal claim or to a crime, we encourage you to seek help from an attorney or your local law enforcement. Specific physical threats should be reported to your local law enforcement immediately.

FAQ
Do I need to be the target of a hateful comment or harassment to report a user?
No. Sometimes an individual target of this behavior may not be aware of the harassment at the time it takes place or may be unable to submit a report. Sometimes hateful comments may not be directed at any one person, but rather at groups of people. Regardless of your level of involvement, hateful conduct and harassment in violation of our Community Guidelines can be reported if observed taking place.

Do I have to have to communicate a behavior is undesired for it to be considered harassment and report the user?
No, however in some contexts, content or activity that appears to be harassing may be unintentional and, upon being told their actions are making others uncomfortable, the user may correct their behavior. You may also decide that some forms of harassment are severe enough to warrant reporting without first communicating they are unwanted. If you feel it is safe and appropriate to do so, we recommend you clearly communicate the conduct is unwanted.  If the unwanted behavior persists, we recommend you report the user and consider other options to manage the situation such as blocking the user’s account(s) or banning them from chat.
